## Welcome to ETNCRAFT - The AIO Electroneum miner 

This is an ongoing project that we hope to spawn into something bigger!
We are hard at work making this GUI as user friendly as possible.
Feel free to send us a message if you have any ideas or features you would like to see.

FEATURES
* Hardware temperature monitoring with alerts above 90 degrees
* Pool/Hash information embedded into application
* Auto load configuration
* Selectable pool list that is automatically updated.
* Logging capabilities
* Lots more that i cannot think of currently

If this project is successful and has interest.
We plan to adapt the GUI to support multiple crypto currencies with the ease of a few clicks.

Let us know how we are doing! CraftMinerTeam@gmail.com
